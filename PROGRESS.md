# MLS Implementation Progress

## Overview
Implementing MLS (Message Layer Security) messaging in dialog_client and dialog_cli, following the Whitenoise architecture patterns.

## Progress Log

### Implementation Complete âœ…
- [x] Add NIP-44 dependencies to dialog_client
- [x] Implement encrypted messaging functionality  
- [x] Add CLI commands for encrypted messaging operations
- [x] Test E2E encryption between Alice and Bob
- [x] Add UniFFI bindings
- [x] Update iOS app with basic UI for encrypted messaging

### Final Result ðŸŽ‰
**2024-07-01**: Successfully implemented complete encrypted messaging system
- âœ… Added encrypted messaging functions to DialogClient using NIP-44
- âœ… CLI supports: send-encrypted, fetch-encrypted, create-group, send-group-message, show-key
- âœ… Added persistent key support with --key global option
- âœ… E2E test passed: Alice and Bob successfully exchanged encrypted messages
- âœ… UniFFI bindings implemented for iOS integration
- âœ… iOS app updated with comprehensive UI for keys, messages, and groups (cross-platform compatible)

### Next Steps (Future Development)
- Integrate actual UniFFI bindings into iOS app (requires build system setup)
- Upgrade to full MLS when available in stable rust-nostr
- Add message persistence and sync
- Implement group state management

## Technical Decisions
- MLS functionality not yet available in stable rust-nostr, implementing NIP-44 first
- Using NIP-44 encrypted messaging as stepping stone to eventual MLS
- Custom event kinds for encrypted messages and group metadata
- Will upgrade to MLS when rust-nostr supports it
