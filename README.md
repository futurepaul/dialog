# Nostr Dialog - Secure Messaging Infrastructure

A Rust monorepo for building secure Nostr messaging applications with authenticated relays and the new Whitenoise DM protocol.

## ðŸŽ‰ Current Status: Basic Functionality Working!

**âœ… End-to-End Tested**: Notes can be published and retrieved through CLI with a working authenticated relay.

- **Relay**: Properly configured and running on port 7979 with debug logging
- **CLI**: Fully functional publish/fetch/test commands
- **Client**: Basic note operations working via nostr-sdk
- **Testing**: Comprehensive E2E test suite passing all scenarios

## Overview

This project implements a complete Nostr messaging ecosystem with:
- **NIP-42 Authentication**: Relay-level authentication for secure connections
- **NIP-70 Protected Events**: Private event support for secure messaging
- **Negentropy Sync**: Efficient set reconciliation protocol
- **Whitenoise Protocol**: Next-generation encrypted direct messaging (not NIP-04/NIP-17)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ with cargo
- iOS development: Xcode 14+ (for iOS app)
- UniFFI tools for iOS bindings (future)

### Building

```bash
# Build all Rust components
cargo build --workspace

# Build specific component
cargo build -p dialog_client

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run comprehensive E2E test
./e2e_test.sh
```

### Testing with CLI âœ… Working

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start relay
cargo run -p dialog_relay

# Terminal 2: Publish a note
cargo run -p dialog_cli publish "Hello Nostr!" --relay ws://127.0.0.1:7979

# Terminal 3: Fetch notes
cargo run -p dialog_cli fetch --limit 5 --relay ws://127.0.0.1:7979

# Run comprehensive tests
./e2e_test.sh
```

## Development

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed development guidelines and architecture decisions.

## Security

This project prioritizes security:
- All relay connections require authentication (implementing)
- MLS-based protocol for end-to-end encryption (planned)
- No logging of private keys or sensitive data
- Constant-time cryptographic operations
