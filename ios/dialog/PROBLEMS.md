# iOS Integration Problems

## Current State
- ✅ We have working CLI with whitenoise MLS
- ✅ We have working relay on port 7979  
- ✅ We have generated UniFFI Swift bindings in dialog_ios/
- ❌ iOS app cannot import DialogClient module

## Failed Approach
1. Tried to add UniFFI bindings as local package dependency
2. Tried copying Swift files directly into Xcode project
3. Build fails because:
   - dialog_client.swift requires dialog_clientFFI module
   - FFI module not properly configured in Xcode project
   - dylib linking issues

## Root Problem
**Complex Xcode project setup vs simple Swift test**

## Minimal Test Needed
Instead of full iOS app integration, we need:
1. Simple Swift script that imports dialog_ios package
2. Test basic DialogClient creation and method calls
3. Verify Rust->Swift bridge works with minimal example

## Next Steps
1. Create minimal Swift test script outside Xcode
2. Test basic DialogClient functionality 
3. Verify CLI roundtrip messaging works
4. Build from there with working foundations

## Key Learning
High probability approach: Start with simplest possible working example, not complex integration.
